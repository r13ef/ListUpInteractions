# List up interactions with a small state space.
## Introduction
The hydrodynamic limit is a mathematical method that derives macroscopic deterministic partial differential equations as limits from microscopic large-scale interacting systems. 
In the series of studies Bannai-Kametani-Sasada [^BKS] and Bannai-Sasada[^BS], they prove Varadahn's decomposition theorem for a general class of large-scale interacting systems. 
In their setting, microscopic large-scale interacting systems is represented by interactions. 
In the recent study [^BSb], Bannai-Sasada generalizes the definition of interaction.
In our paper [^BKSWY], we will provide a classification of interactions with a small state space.
For the definitions, please see the paper.

This program provides a list of interactions that are exchangeable and separable. 
In our list, we identify interactions that are equivalent to each other.

On can find the list of exchangeable separable interactions with a state space size of 4 or 5 in /output.

> [!WARNING]
> Since this computation takes a lot of time, please be careful when using this program if the state space is large.
